See: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/mdx

I defined the story here, to keep the example straightforward. You can also
write your stories in CSF and reference them in MDX. There are two approaches
to that:
- https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-mdx-docs
- https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-arbitrary-mdx

I personally favor the second approach if I need MDX docs.

<!--
[1]: By default (most frameworks) render stories inline. This opts out of that,
     to render each story in its own iFrame, thus providing each story with its
     own viewport. I set this at the component (meta) level, to apply to all
     stories in the file, but you could also set it globally or at the story
     level. There can be performance issues if you have a large amount of
     stories on one page, due to the number of individual iFrames.
[2]: This is how you define the viewport width that will be applied to the
     Canvas wrapping a story. I set this at the component (meta) level, to apply
     to all stories in the file, but you could also set it at the story level.
